## Social Authentication

Azure App Service provides built-in support for Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.  Irrespective of whether
you intend to use server-flow or client-flow, you will need to configure the Azure App Service Authentication /
Authorization service.  The method is pretty similar in each case:

1.  Obtain a Developer Account for the provider.
2.  Create a new application, obtaining a Client ID and Secret.
3.  Turn on Azure App Service Authentication.
4.  Enter the Client ID and Secret into the specific provider setup.
5.  Save the configuration.

Before you start any of this, create a new Azure Mobile Apps as we described in [Chapter 1][chapter1].  If you want
a site to deploy for the configuration, the **Backend** project in the [Chapter2][10] solution is pre-configured for
authorization. You just need to deploy it to Azure App Service.

## Facebook Configuration

I am going to assume you have a Facebook account already.  If you do not have a Facebook account, go to [Facebook][8]
and sign up.  All your friends are likely there already!  Now log in to the [Facebook Developers][9] web site.  Create
a new Facebook application:

![Facebook Developers][img2]

**Note**: Facebook updates the look and feel of their developer site on a regular basis.  As a result, the screen shots
I have provided here may be different.  If in doubt, follow the bullet descriptions to find your way.

!!! info
    If you are not already registered, Click the drop-down in the top-right corner and **Register as a Developer**
    before continuing.

* Click the **My Apps** link in the top right corner of the screen.
* Click **Create a New App**.
* Fill in the form:

![Create a new Application][img3]

* If required, verify your account according to the instructions.  This usually involves typing a CAPTCHA text, adding a credit card number and/or verifying your mobile phone number.

* Click the **Get Started** button next to **Facebook Login**.
* Click **Settings** under **Facebook Login** in the left-hand menu.

![Facebook Login][img4]

* Enter your application URL + `/.auth/login/facebook/callback` in the **Valid OAuth redirect URIs**.

![Facebook OAuth redirect URIs][img5]

* Click **Save Changes**.
* Click the **Settings** (under **Dashboard**) in the left-hand menu.
* Click the **Show** button next to the App Secret

Now that you have the **App ID** and **App Secret**, you can continue configuration of your app within the
[Azure Portal][portal].

* Open up your App Service by clicking on **All Resources** or **App Services** followed by the name of your app service.
* In the **Settings** blade, Click **Authentication / Authorization** which is under **Features**.
* Turn **App Service Authentication** to **On**.
* In the **Action to take when request is not authenticated**, select **Allow Anonymous requests (no action)**.

!!! danger
    It is very tempting to choose **Log in with Facebook**.  However, you need to avoid this.  Selecting this option will mean that all requests need to be authenticated and you will not get the information about the identity on the back end.  Selecting **Allow Anonymous requests** means your app is in charge of what gets authenticated and what does not require authentication.

* Click **Facebook** (which should show _Not Configured_).
* Cut and Paste the **App ID** and **App Secret** into the boxes provided.
* Select **public_profile** and **email** for Scopes.

!!! warn
    If you request anything but public_profile, user_friends, and email, your app will need further review by
    Facebook, which will take time.  This process is not worth it for test apps like this one.

* Click **OK** (at the bottom of the blade) to close the Facebook configuration blade.
* Click **Save** (at the top of the blade) to save your Authentication changes.

You can test your authentication process by browsing to https://_yoursite_.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/facebook;
this is the same endpoint that the Azure Mobile Apps Client SDK calls when it is time to integrate authentication
into the mobile client.

![Confirming Facebook Authentication][img6]

If you are not logged in to facebook already, you will be prompted for your facebook credentials first.  Finally,
here is your happy page - the page that signifies you have done everything right:

![Authentication Succeeded][img7]

!!! warn
    Every single OAuth provider will ask you what sort of information you want to have access to.  These "claims"
    translate into permissions.  The more permissions you request, the less likely the user is going to accept
    them.  Be a good net citizen and only request the information you are actually going to use.

## Google Configuration

It should be no shock that you need a [Google Account][11] to get started.  If you do not have one already (or you
want a different account for your development activities), create a new account now.  Then log in to the
[Google Developer Portal][12].  Click the **Create Project** link at the top:

![New Google Project][img8]

Enter a nice name, then Click **Create**.  The screen will show the progress and eventually the project
will be listed in the **All Projects** list.  It takes about 30 seconds to create a project.  Once you have your
Google project, the API Manager Library will show up.  If Google decides to change the end place, Click the hamburger menu (in the top-left corner), select **API Manager**, followed by **Library** to see all the Google APIs you can enable:

![Google APIs Library][img9]

There is no "Google Login" that can guide you here.  The API you need to add is called **Google+** and is listed under the **Social APIs**.  Click **Google+ API**, then click **Enable** at the top of the screen.

Adding an API to a Google app doesn't mean it is ready to use.  In our case, we need to configure the login process.  Google has, of course, set this up so that it's easy to access a Google service, but difficult to use the authentication for other purposes.  Configure Google login as follows:

1.  Click **Credentials** in the left-hand menu.
2.  Select the **OAuth consent screen** tab:

    ![Google OAuth Credential][img10]

    Fill in the form and Click **Save**.  
3.  **Create Credentials** button.  This pops up a drop-down menu.  You want the **OAuth Client ID**.

    ![Google Create Credentials][img11]

4.  Select **Web application**.

    ![Google Create Client ID][img12]

5.  Enter the URL of your App Service in the **Authorized JavaScript origins** box.  Ensure you use the https version of the URL.
6.  Enter `https://_yoursite_.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/google/callback` in the **Authorized redirect URIs** box.
7.  Click **Create**.
8.  Google will display your client ID and client secret.

You can also view the Client ID and Client Secret from the interface by clicking on the **Credentials** link on the left-hand menu.

The process from here is practically the same as Facebook.  Open your App Service within the Azure Portal, Click
**All Settings**, then **Authentication / Authorization** and finally **Google** (assuming you have already turned
on the authentication service).  Copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the boxes provided.  Click
**OK** (at the bottom) followed by **Save** (at the top of the page).

!!! info
    You can define multiple providers at the same time.  The code in the client determines what authentication mechanism is used.

You can test this just like Facebook.  Go to https://_yoursite_/.auth/login/google with your browser.  You should see something like the following:

![Confirming Google Authentication][img13]

Confirming here should get us to the same happy screen we achieved with Facebook.

If you happen to mis-type the Authorized redirect URI, Google will inform you that the URI is wrong.  I inevitably swap http for https.  When this happens, it is an easy fix, but you have to wait a few minutes before the authentication system updates itself.

!!! warn
    Google has changed the security semantics for its authentication service.  You must use the v3.1.0 of the Azure Mobile Apps Client SDK for Server Flow authentication with Google to work.

## Microsoft Account Configuration

The advantage of the Microsoft Account (or MSA, as it is known) is that you already have an account - you need 
one for accessing Azure in general.  Go to the [Microsoft Account Developer Center][13] and log on with 
your Microsoft account.  You should use the same one as you use for Azure, but it is not required.

![Microsoft Account Developer Center][img14]

Just to confuse us, there are two **Add an App** buttons. Strangely, they are different. Click the one next to
**Converged applications**.

![MSA: Create an application][img15]

Enter an awesome name, then lick **Create application**.

![MSA: Add a Platform][img16]

Click **Add Platform**, followed by **Web**.  In the **Redirect URIs**, enter your app URL +
`/.auth/login/microsoftaccount/callback`. Then Click **Save**.

![MSA: Redirect URI][img17]

Now Click **Generate New Password** under **Application Secrets**.

![MSA: New password][img18]

Unlike the other social providers, this is the only time you will get to see your client secret, so make a note of it or copy and paste it into a notepad.  Once you have it copied somewhere, Click **OK**, followed by **Save**.

You now have all the information you need to configure the Microsoft Account section within your App Server
Authentication / Authorization.  The Client ID you need to enter is the Application ID and the Client Secret is the
password you just copied somewhere.

![MSA: Configuration of App Service][img19]

Note that you have to choose claims that you want to read.  The **wl.basic** and **wl.emails** will give you enough
information to get started with this tutorial.

Click **OK** (at the bottom), followed by **Save** (at the top).  You can test the settings by pointing your browser
to https://_yoursite_.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/microsoftaccount.  You will see what should be a normal claims
request page:

![MSA: Claims Request][img20]

Clicking on **Yes** should take you to the normal success page.

## Twitter Configuration

I hope you are seeing that all the OAuth providers take a very similar route to configuring their service.  The semantics of the service are slightly different in each case.  Twitter is no different.  As you might expect, before continuing, sign up for [Twitter][14].  Once you have signed up, the [Twitter Developers Portal][15] is your next stop. Once there, click **Create New App**:

![Twitter: New App][img21]

Most of the fields are self-explanatory.  The **Callback URL** is the same thing that the other social providers have
called the Redirect URL.  The appropriate value is your app URL + `/.auth/login/twitter/callback`.  There is a legal
agreement at the bottom of the page, then you can Click **Create your Twitter application** button.

!!! danger
    All social authentication providers have some sort of legal agreement that governs their use.  In general, demo or
    PoC apps are fair use.  However, you should get a legal opinion before using a social authentication provider in a
    production app.

Once you have created the app, you will get a tabbed display with all the settings.  Click the **Keys and Access
Tokens** tab:

![Twitter: Keys][img22]

Note the values for the **Consumer Key (API Key)** and **Consumer Secret (API Secret)**.  They get entered into the
Azure Portal.

!!! warn
    There is a check box in the **Settings** tab that says _Allow this application to be used to Sign in with Twitter_.
    At the time of writing, this is checked by default.  However, if you find you can not log in for some reason, then
    ensure this checkbox is checked.

Back in the Azure Portal, select your app service, then **All Settings**, **Authentication / Authorization**, and
finally **Twitter** (assuming you have already turned Authentication on).  You can now cut and paste the Consumer
Key and Consumer Secret into the appropriate boxes, before clicking on **OK** (at the bottom) followed by **Save**
(at the top).

As with the other providers, you should test the authentication flow by pointing your browser to
https://_yoursite_.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/twitter.

![Twitter: Authorize App][img23]

Clicking on **Authorize app** should show you our normal successful authentication screen.

The social authentication providers should now all be configured to handle a web-based or server-flow authentication
request.  There are times when configuring a client-flow authentication is different.  We will point those out when we
get to them.

## Adding Authentication to a Mobile Client

Now that the backend is completely configured, we can move our attention to the mobile client.  We are going to be
using the same mobile client that we developed in the first chapter, but we are now going to add authentication to
it.  Web views are one of those items that are platform dependent. Fortunately for us, Xamarin has already thought
of this and provided a facility for running platform specific code called the [DependencyService][22].

!!! info
    If you have already implemented authentication during the Enterprise Authentication section, this code is the
    same.  You just have to alter the provider name.

If we run our application right now, clicking on the "Enter the App" button will result in an error.  You will be
able to see the Unauthorized error in the debug window of Visual Studio.  Our first step is to define an
`Abstractions\ILoginProvider.cs` interface within the shared project:

```csharp
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public interface ILoginProvider
    {
        Task LoginAsync(MobileServiceClient client);
    }
}
```

Next, we extend our `Abstractions\ICloudService.cs` interface so that the main application can call the login routine:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public interface ICloudService
    {
        ICloudTable<T> GetTable<T>() where T : TableData;

        Task LoginAsync();
    }
}
```

Our code will call `LoginAsync()` in the `ICloudService`, which will get the platform-specific version of the
login provider and call `LoginAsync()` there, but with our defined mobile service client.  That is defined in the
`Services\AzureCloudService.cs` class:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.Helpers;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList.Services
{
    public class AzureCloudService : ICloudService
    {
        MobileServiceClient client;

        public AzureCloudService()
        {
            client = new MobileServiceClient(Locations.AppServiceUrl);
        }

        public ICloudTable<T> GetTable<T>() where T : TableData => new AzureCloudTable<T>(client);

        public Task LoginAsync()
        {
            var loginProvider = DependencyService.Get<ILoginProvider>();
            return loginProvider.LoginAsync(client);
        }
    }
}
```

The method looks up the platform dependent version of the login provider and executes the login method, passing
along the client (which we will need later).

In each platform-specific project, we are going to define a concrete implementation of the login provider that uses
a web view to hold the actual authentication flow.  Here is the droid `Services\DroidLoginProvider.cs` (in the
TaskList.Droid project):

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Android.Content;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.Droid.Services;

[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(DroidLoginProvider))]
namespace TaskList.Droid.Services
{
    public class DroidLoginProvider : ILoginProvider
    {
        Context context;

        public void Init(Context context)
        {
            this.context = context;
        }

        public async Task LoginAsync(MobileServiceClient client)
        {
            await client.LoginAsync(context, "facebook");
        }
    }
}
```

!!! tip
    Replace "facebook" with "google", "microsoftaccount" or "twitter", depending on your identity provider.

Let us take a closer look at this implementation.  The `LoginAsync()` method on the Azure Mobile Apps client object
takes the Android context (which is normally the main window) and a provider - we can pick any of "facebook",
"google", "microsoftaccount", "twitter" or "aad" depending on what we have defined in the Azure App Service.  The
clever piece is the `Xamarin.Forms.Dependency` call at the top - that registers the class as a platform service
so we can access it through the Xamarin dependency service.

Note that we need an extra initialization routine for Android that must be called prior the login provider being
called to pass along the main window of the app (also known as the context).  This is done in the `MainActivity.cs`
file **after** the Xamarin Forms initialization call.  The dependency service is not set up until after the Xamarin
Forms library is initialized, so we will not be able to get the login provider reference before that point:

```csharp
protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
{
    base.OnCreate(bundle);

    Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.CurrentPlatform.Init();

    global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, bundle);

    ((DroidLoginProvider)DependencyService.Get<ILoginProvider>()).Init(this);

    LoadApplication(new App());
}
```

iOS is similar, but does not require the initialization step in the main startup class.  The login provider class
is in `Services\iOSLoginProvider.cs` (in the **TaskList.iOS** project):

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.iOS.Services;
using UIKit;

[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(iOSLoginProvider))]
namespace TaskList.iOS.Services
{
    public class iOSLoginProvider : ILoginProvider
    {
        public async Task LoginAsync(MobileServiceClient client)
        {
            await client.LoginAsync(RootView, "facebook");
        }

        public UIViewController RootView => UIApplication.SharedApplication.KeyWindow.RootViewController;
    }
}
```

Note that we are using the same pattern here for registering the concrete implementation with the dependency service,
so we can get it the same way. Finally, here is the UWP `Services\UWPLoginProvider.cs` (in the TaskList.UWP project):

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.UWP.Services;

[assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency(typeof(UWPLoginProvider))]
namespace TaskList.UWP.Services
{
    public class UWPLoginProvider : ILoginProvider
    {
        public async Task LoginAsync(MobileServiceClient client)
        {
            await client.LoginAsync("facebook");
        }
    }
}
```

Now that we have all the platform-specific login routines registered, we can move on to adding the login routine to
the UI.  We have already got a button on the entry page to enter the app.  It makes sense to wire up that button so
that it logs us in as well. The Command for the login button is in the `ViewModels\EntryPageViewModel.cs`:

```csharp
async Task ExecuteLoginCommand()
{
    if (IsBusy)
        return;
    IsBusy = true;

    try
    {
        var cloudService = ServiceLocator.Instance.Resolve<ICloudService>();
        await cloudService.LoginAsync();
        Application.Current.MainPage = new NavigationPage(new Pages.TaskList());
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"[ExecuteLoginCommand] Error = {ex.Message}");
    }
    finally
    {
        IsBusy = false;
    }
}
```

!!! info
    The `ServiceLocator` class is my basic singleton handler.  It is available in the [Chapter2][10] project.  It
    returns the concrete version of the cloud service, just like the Singleton version we defined in Chapter1.

When you run the application, clicking on the "Enter the App" button will now present you with an Authenticate window:

![Facebook Authenticate][img58]

Going through the authentication process will get you to the task list again.  If the authentication process fails,
then `LoginAsync()` will throw an error, which is caught at the ViewModel.  Right now, the `EntryPageViewModel`
does nothing more than print a diagnostic message to the debug window of Visual Studio.

!!! info "Integrating with multiple providers"
    Each provider has a slightly different server flow.  In the [Chapter2] project, I use this to call the 
    right provider endpoint.  When the user clicks on the Facebook logo, for instance, it logs in with
    Facebook.  It's up to you as to how this UI is presented.

## Client-Flow for Social Providers

In each of the social providers, the identity provider SDK (provided by Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Twitter) 
will need to be integrated.  In general, these SDKs are provided for a native platform (Objective-C or Swift 
for iOS, Java for Android), use callbacks or delegates (as is common practice in native libraries) and are thus 
more complicated to integrate with your mobile client than those that have a C#/.NET SDK delivered on NuGet.

!!! warn
    Testing Client Flow for social providers requires that the social app be installed on the device.  You cannot
    install other apps on the iOS simulator and there may be restrictions on the Android Emulator.  This means that
    you generally need to test client flow for social providers on an actual device.

The reward for doing so are a more integrated experience on mobile devices.  For example, if you integrate 
the Google Play Services SDK in an Android app, the app will seamlessly authenticate itself with the 
connected Google account in the background, avoiding the need for repeatedly authenticating the client.  It may
ask for a fingerprint instead if the app is not trusted.  If you integrate the Facebook SDK, then the app will 
automatically switch to the Facebook app and ask you to approve the authentication request there instead of 
authenticating the user through a web view.  Both of these provide a more integrated experience for the end user, 
so this work is well worth pursuing.

As an example, here is the client flow for Facebook.  I've implemented this using the `Xamarin.Facebook.iOS` 
library, which can be downloaded and installed into the iOS project from NuGet.  The `Services\iOSLoginProvider.cs` contains the following:

```csharp
        #region Facebook Client Flow
        private TaskCompletionSource<string> fbtcs;

        public async Task<string> LoginFacebookAsync()
        {
            fbtcs = new TaskCompletionSource<string>();
            var loginManager = new LoginManager();

            loginManager.LogInWithReadPermissions(new[] { "public_profile" }, RootView, LoginTokenHandler);
            return await fbtcs.Task;
        }

        private void LoginTokenHandler(LoginManagerLoginResult loginResult, NSError error)
        {
            if (loginResult.Token != null)
            {
                fbtcs.TrySetResult(loginResult.Token.TokenString);
            }
            else
            {
                fbtcs.TrySetException(new Exception("Facebook Client Flow Login Failed"));
            }
        }
        #endregion
```

Note the use of a `TaskCompletionSource<>()` here.  This is used often to convert callback APIs into awaitable APIs.
We set off the async call with the callback, then await on the completion (which is signified by the
`TaskCompletionSource`).  When the callback is called, it sets the value of the `TaskCompletionSource` (or causes
an exception) and that causes the task to complete.

The `LoginAsync()` method can now be updated like this:

```csharp
        public async Task LoginAsync(MobileServiceClient client)
        {
            var accessToken = await LoginFacebookAsync();
            var zumoPayload = new JObject()
            {
                ["access_token"] = accessToken
            };
            await client.LoginAsync("facebook", zumoPayload);
        }

        public UIViewController RootView => UIApplication.SharedApplication.KeyWindow.RootViewController;
```

Finally, you need to configure your Facebook settings within the `Info.plist` file.  Right-click the `Info.plist` file and select **Open with...**.  Select the XML editor.  Add the following to the file within the `<dict>` element (right before the closing `</dict>`):

```xml
	<key>FacebookAppID</key>
	<string>YOUR-APP-ID</string>
    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>fbauth2</string>
	</array>
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>fbYOUR-APP-ID</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
```

Replace **YOUR-APP-ID** with the Facebook App ID from the Facebook developers console.

With this version, clicking on the login button will seamlessly switch into the Facebook application and ask the
user to confirm the request, before switching back authenticated.  Note that it's likely that the Facebook SDK 
will not work within a simulator as it requires the Facebook app to be installed.

There are a number of pre-built Xamarin libraries for handling provider authentication.  For iOS, we have already shown Azure Active Directory and Facebook. Android has its own version of the [Facebook SDK](https://components.xamarin.com/view/facebookandroid).  Use the [Google .NET API](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/) to access Google accounts.  It's already cross-platform.  In general, using the library from the provider itself is preferable to using one from a third party.
